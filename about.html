            <h1>My Political View</h1>
            <p>
                I consider myself to be a center progressive. I have always wanted the world to be better by advancing as a society as one. I believe that with enough work, every ugly bit of society will be Thanos-snapped out of existence. Even though I believe this, I do believe that this will take decades, maybe even centuries. Therefore, my foundation focuses on continuing my agenda until it is achieved.

            <h1>How I became anti-Jorgen</h1>
            <p>
                My political interest started when I was born. Due to my father and his forefathers being highly influential political figures in history, I obviously was forced into politics. I had quite the political opinion as a child. Because of my forefather's propaganda, I believed that Toyland was terrible, until we came and made it a piece of glory and greatness, then they fought a war against us and made Toyland terrible again. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, I did not question that narrative until much later when I decided to hear what the Toylanders thought about Jorgenberg. I learned about the history of it on Youtube in secret (due to me being the heir, I had been allowed to use Youtube, despite it being banned in former Jorgenberg), and after a secret trip to Toyland to interview citizens there, I came up with the conclusion that Jorgenberg was the terrible one, not Toyland.

            <h1>My political Career</h1>
            <p>
                My political career began when my father was sick and I had to replace him for a while. For 15 days, I was supreme leader. My father survived his sickness, but during those 15 days, I knew how it was to be in power, and was more exposed to the horrors behind Jorgenberg due to me being the leader. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When my father died and I officially became supreme leader of Jorgenberg for life, I immediately knew I would have to undo every mistake my forefathers did, with the biggest one being Jorgenberg. The first thing I did was provide a more democratic system for the people in 2013. I also did a lot of fundraising for the poverty, and in 2017, I re-united Jorgenberg and Toyland for the first time in over 200 years. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After the two nations re-united, I decided to move to Legoland and enjoy a life in Toyland, a place and culture I was rarely exposed to. After pressure from some of my supporters in Legoland, I decided to run for governor in Legoland. On the second try, I won, and became what professional historian and highly anti-Jorgenberg, Jack Maley, the 3rd best governor in all of Legoland history. I helped lower the poverty percentage by over 40%. I also helped convince the central government to improve the anti-monopolistic acts laws, making small businesses who have no chance with the monopolistic businesses have a bigger change of surviving.
